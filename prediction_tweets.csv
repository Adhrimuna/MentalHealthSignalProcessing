1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby... It would poison the mother if it wasn't removed.
1,And so the mother
1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I think you best read up a little more. Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy. https://t.co/Wf2zVOopJM
1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Contraception isn't 100% effective. Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. 
1,But you'll risk the well-being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked? It doesn't have the organs to survive alone...
1,@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews I'm sorry you had to go through that. The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman.
1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Thanks for informing me on how a human is created... But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks. That is no life. 
1,I suppose you're someone who believes contraception is wrong too?
1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Yet women aren't all given help. You're not killing a baby... It's not alive until it is born
1,Let women make their own choice about their bodies...
1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews What about a mother who was raped
1,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I'm not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn. It happens so often. -_- since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own?

1,@V3rmilion_N1nja Yeah problem is it's not constant. So likelihood of it actually hurting while at drs is slim _٪�
1,@marsbarbarbar Hmm okay. Well if the pain continues past this weekend I'll go to the docs.
1,@marsbarbarbar For the docs I mean
1,@marsbarbarbar I'm not on any medication _��� it's literally out of the blue. I don't want to go to the docs if it's just a migraine. That's a waste of time.
1,@marsbarbarbar True. But it's not like Twitter was the first thing I went to to find info...
1,@marsbarbarbar Thing is I've lost faith a bit due to my back. If it's something docs can see they'll fix
1,@marsbarbarbar True I know. But I don't know how much they can really do. I mean what you gunna do poke it. Yup. Your head hurts. Have painkillers _���_���

1,HEY GUYS FYI I'VE TAKEN ART HISTORY AND BUDDHIST LITERATURE CLASSES AT UNI.
1,PLEASE CLAP.
1,this concept of an imperfect
1,some examples of wabi-sabi in zen  ������_��_: https://t.co/zLGTaPTtnT
1,It is a process of silencing the mind and thus removing the suffering of your own condition
1,"zen buddhism also has a concept I really like known as ""wabi-sabi"". it is the embrace of the ephemeral nature of all things and the imperfections of the human experience. enlightenment doesn't mean you're suddenly infallible"
1,you see this a lot in zen buddhism. there is an effort or lack thereof
0,this is sort of the nature of the phenomenon of the epiphany. it is a momentary grasp of a lucid
1,It is only when we become attached to expectations or external conceptions that by nature limit us or make us smaller that we slip out of that enlightenment. In that sense it is something you can slip in and out of. If all we have is the present
1,I forgot which sect(s) it is but in some form of Buddhism ������ there is the idea that everyone -- by default -- is already a buddha
1,�_�_٠� https://t.co/yBTPgsgPHb
1,https://t.co/kspTz9M8wj
1,https://t.co/u1ZyKQOBWY
1,"if you just see ""god"" as everything both within u and in relation to u as opposed to an omnipresent external judge this becomes a lot easier to process"
1,it's not that there was a specific person with a divine experience it's that we collectively chose to reinforce that idea and maintain it long enough over the course of history for it to be normalized.
1,Or idk that's just an idea. I mean think of how we give religious iconography strength and how faith and perceived cause-effect connections strengthen the impact of those religions.... _�_�
1,If we live in a world of mental energy and symbols and internalization
1,pls retweet https://t.co/1TMMY81mh8
1,I was in much more of a flow then so my transcendent subjective reality began to overlap more with the more mundane objective reality. It seems like whatever mass hysteria I sensed then had kind of died down a bit.
1,I gotta say my external reality certainly has changed significantly since I started posting again in Fall

1,@3hrist what are the evil ones? _�_�
1,Historical revisionism. Plain and simple. The more we recognize propaganda as legitimate the more we're changing the legacy of American imperialism by absolving and softening crimes against humanity. It's appalling and more people should be upset.
1,We're trying to give war criminals the benefit of the doubt with retroactive praise via the mainstream media. You see it with the Bush family
1,RT @chomsky_quotes: One fundamental goal of any well-crafted indoctrination program is to direct attention elsewhere
1,Also why the fuck are we giving Obama a netflix series? We willingly lose paradise more and more every year. Why is HBO releasing a propaganda documentary on McCain just as he's about to croak? Does this not seem weird to anyone else?
1,Think of the impact technology and mass entertainment has had on re-wiring the brains of gen z. They live in a fundamentally warped view of the world.
1,Stop making shitty people famous. Stop making fame seem more important than it is. Reinstill the values that promote a healthy family unit or we'll continue to have parents who raise fuck up reactionary failchildren who resort to murder for attention.
1,In a world where sociopaths aren't given attention they'd rather take a legacy of infamy than no legacy at all. And honestly given how the media chooses to cover and oversaturate certain stories we really have no one but ourselves to blame. It's a byproduct of consumer culture.
1,honestly I think we have the media and entertainment culture to blame for the current political climate and to a large extent the school shooter epidemic. give attention to the wrong things

1,2018: Hipster neurotypicals disregarding context for performative in-group brownie points and self-aggrandizement
1,The people who are denoted as geniuses by contemporary society are often given that status after that person has already become successful via either business or academia. It's retroactive. Clout. A reflection of that person's perceived success. Completely different.
1,I'd say that capitalism doesn't reward genius
1,It also suggests that genius is a product of society or history and not of the mind of an individual. How society perceives or ranks a figure has nothing to do with that individual's objective ability. https://t.co/Dn7lmA0NYh

1,Keep this in mind when you see the NYT

1,Seeing people not grow or learn from mistakes despite being successful or making strides in other aspects of their lives is such a massive disappointment
1,Not even seeing their bad karma unfold in real time brings any sense of grim satisfaction or closure bc ultimately you realize they're the same person they were when they fucked you up. There's just a hollow separateness in which you see someone walking into a wall ad infinitum
1,Or they just plug their ears and go LALALALALALALA while whatever guilt they still have slowly festers inside them

1,A lotta people also have to consider that Buddhism is rough. Like there is a lot of dark shit
1,When cancel culture and media propaganda is no longer the status quo (which will likely not happen for as long as MSM exists) then I may consider saying things more palatable and optimistically righteous or whatever
1,And you know
1,Again
1,Having said that I will still totally dunk on people or tear them to shreds if they abuse power or have shitty takes or make the web deliberately more fractured and toxic. Maybe that's just the nihilist vigilante in me idk. And yeah
1,However
1,I'd say I lean more towards criticizing culture
1,@ByYourLogic are there still hostages
1,If we can widen the range of discussion for our lively debate to occur in that's a pro in my book
1,I try to use humor to frame a lot of my more taboo opinions but I know for a fact a LOT of people don't get me or find me funny and I'm cool with that because that's the position of vulnerability you have to put yourself in to make a difference
1,I mean I hate cops. So there's that. I hate Israel. Tricky

1,I'm not really sure how I can frame my content lol.
1,You're perfectly free to disagree with me or call me a bigot but frankly I'm detached enough from my online persona for it to impact my day to day life. It's completely another thing if or as soon as my career enters the public sphere but idc my life is already in shambles
1,there are definitely a lot of shitty people with shady morals about but I still think the majority are just pretty normal people who are against mainstream bipartisanship and normie scum. I often due things to offend but primarily for the sake of widening a window of discussion
1,Even though I consider myself primarily a leftist anarchist I sometimes resonate more with certain alt-lite trolls than tankies you know what I mean
1,leftist twitter beef is such a joke lol. I have such a weak grasp on the political spectrum of most of the accounts I like. I follow a ton of people on here I disagree with significantly but I follow them because I think it's important to observe the gestalt of the discourse

1,@KevinShau An argument we can have again
1,@KevinShau I think we remember that conversation very differently.  I quoted several lines of Peterson's and put them up against the data that corresponded
1,@KevinShau I'd be very quick to be wary on any stat with one source.  Given that I've attempted to include multiple articles with the same points on anything you have asked for sources on.
1,@KevinShau We had a very large debate about the Wage gap on Facebook
1,@KevinShau I would refer you back to my multiple tweets regarding how I do my research that include looking through sources such as Brietbart
1,@KevinShau You can skip the parts you find offensive
1,@KevinShau We have already had discussions of me breaking apart both Shapiro and Peterson's videos piece by piece.  We can do more of that

1,"@KevinShau You should know pretty well that I break from the ""leftist"" mold quite frequently.  I do thorough research through multiple sources from both ""sides"""

1,@KevinShau 2/2 One for you
1,https://t.co/4YCHPuexGH
1,@KevinShau 1/2: I'm worried that your claim for sources will result in your attempt to attack reputable news organizations instead of furthering discussion.
1,That being said:
1,@KevinShau You asked for sources in a second tweet
1,@KevinShau For instance:  Violent crime by illegal immigrants is a huge issue in this country.  Emotionally? That may seem agreeable to a lot of people.  Factually
1,@KevinShau Spoiler: That's the point.
1,"@KevinShau ""Data is objective"
1,I'm going to just let that sit there so you can just rethink that sentence. Think about that one REAL hard.
1,@KevinShau Thats because Peterson makes sure to debate reporters and students
1,@KevinShau I'm sorry you see it that way
1,@KevinShau If there is greater access
1,@KevinShau I'm aware of biases in media and I take my news from either the most direct point possible
1,@KevinShau You're not commenting on my point.  I'm not saying that CNN is right
1,@KevinShau I'll repeat:  All his fans are not alt-right
1,@KevinShau Just because I hate Kevin Spacey does not mean kevin spacey also hates me
1,@KevinShau Peterson also works in the same way the alt-right does
1,"@KevinShau Nobody I have seen is saying ""all his fans are alt-right"""
1,A lot of people are saying he has a very large alt-right fanbase
1,@KevinShau Regardless of Peterson's true feelings towards the alt-right
1,@KevinShau Dealing in facts is a much better way to get results. Dealing in opinions generally leads to emotional reactions over sensible reactions.
1,"@KevinShau I saw it was neck and neck with John Oliver's ""Marlon Bundo"" book for a while"
1,@KevinShau I'm not mischaracterizing Pool.  He said that Peterson does like like the alt-right
1,@KevinShau The only other self described news I had seen it done on was Jones
1,@KevinShau If someone somehow found that Vox article before any other information
1,@KevinShau I'm not characterizing
1,@KevinShau He's a pseudo-intellectual snake oil salesman.  I know I'm attacking him as a person
1,@KevinShau Pool
1,@KevinShau This is not journalism
1,@KevinShau 9/?
1,Pool so far has not shown any evidence the alt right doesn't like peterson(minus a quote from..peterson)
1,Also He did not even dismissed his OWN straw-man argument provided at the beginning of this video.
1,@KevinShau 8/?
1,"Pool earlier attacked the media for exageratting subscribers on youtube by saying ""thousands"" when in reality it is ""millions"".  He then goes back to say it is not millions.  (So at the least they are both idiots?)."
1,@KevinShau 7/?
1,Hold on
1,"@KevinShau 6/?  This is a 16 minute video and 10 minutes has been spent saying Peterson says he doesn't play identity politics"".  Pool made a point to say the alt-right doesnt like Peterson"
1,@KevinShau 5/?
1,"Also:  Pool keeps saying that ""Peterson denied being alt right meaning he doesn't have alt right fans"" but that is a logical fallacy in itself. Peterson can dislike the alt-right"
1,"@KevinShau 4/?He attacks the ""daily dot"" opinion article"
1,@KevinShau 3/?
1,"Pool criticizes an old video for saying Peterson has ""hundreds of thousands of followers"" on youtube when it is actually just over a million.  Seems nitpicky"
1,@KevinShau 2/?
1,Then he asked for money(is this alex jones?!).  Then he said that the alt-right couldn't love peterson
1,@KevinShau 1/?  I watched another one of Pool's videos:
1,Why is the media lying about Jordan Peterson(I thought it was relevant to the rest of this topic).
1,He starts out by creating a strawman argument that Peterson is aligning with facist organizations.
1,"@KevinShau ""Peterson himself said in his Channel 4 interview that 80 percent of his YouTube audience is male. These young men are upset about . .  the need to compete with women and minorities for jobs and spots at top universities"
1,@KevinShau Additionally
1,@KevinShau While I'm not in love with the source website
1,https://t.co/71Fx8cTKCH
1,"@KevinShau There is another LARGE difference between a ""unpopular"" position"
1,@KevinShau 3/3: Those letters also affirmed Peterson�۪s free speech rights and his right to academic freedom.
1,@KevinShau 2/3: One letter suggested that he could easily avoid contributing to discrimination by using a student�۪s first name
1,@KevinShau 1/3: That is avoiding the point that Peterson was upset at a bill for something the bill did not do.  Instead of targeting the code
1,@KevinShau I do not know his work
1,@KevinShau No
1,@KevinShau https://t.co/Hw0mt7pRCR
1,@KevinShau We have discussed this numerous times
1,@KevinShau I'm sure it would
1,@KevinShau There are plenty of experts in that field.  None of which have said that Women want to help muslims so they can be dominated.
1,Peterson is in the wrong here
1,"@KevinShau and ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination"" is not an interest or desire of an entire gender"
1,I'd argue if you browse craigslist
1,"@KevinShau There is a LARGE difference between saying not ""only great things"" and ""Sexist"
1,@KevinShau 3/2: Now to be fair
1,@KevinShau Not every piece that outs a fraud is a hit piece
1,Not to mention Peterson has *multiple times* touted his honorary tribal membership that does not exist
1,@KevinShau If you are trying to claim this man as a good journalist
1,@KevinShau I have to have some fun!
1,Did you read the piece though?
1,@KevinShau That neither addressed my point nor made one

1,@KevinShau I am not going to argue if that is right or wrong
1,@KevinShau It is not good.  So Peterson is right that it is a bad movie

1,#NAME?
1,My sources win Pulitzer prizes
1,@KevinShau I don't recall Tim Pool arguing that opinion pieces are the downfall of media.  This is an opinion piece you are attacking.
0,@KevinShau Peterson argued that the Disney movie Frozen is propaganda which isn't relevant but is pretty hilarious
1,"@KevinShau Peterson also argued that women support the Muslim plight because it matched with their ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination'"
1,@KevinShau This coincidentally is in an interview with Peterson from Time magazine. Slippery slope present and highlighted https://t.co/fkfjyNgtz9
1,@KevinShau Your using Pool repeatedly as an example of an intellectual is laughable. He won an unrecognizable award(same award was given to Epic Meal Time and Justin Bieber)
1,He also was named Time person solely for live streaming an event on twitter. Hardly prestige earning
1,@KevinShau It's an analysis based in fact.

1,@KevinShau So let's allow people to be discriminated against?
1,Fix the politics

1,Don't say oh well it confuses me so let's let these people suffer discrimination
1,@KevinShau So
1,Instead of working to define these terms
1,@KevinShau That's is a false analogy
1,@KevinShau When has that happened? And don't mention Canada because we have discussed that isn't what the law is
1,@KevinShau Can you provide evidence? I'd argue it was on the decline slowly and the legislation speeded up the decline
1,@KevinShau A transgender person is an individual
1,@KevinShau Though most do
1,@KevinShau Most biological males also identify as straight
1,@KevinShau Another humans gender identity affects you in no wsy. Forcing them to narrow theirs down to once of two is unnecessary and wrong
1,@KevinShau You're thinking of biological sex
1,@KevinShau I trust a group of well informed and educated people more than the mass population.
1,@KevinShau Shaming a gender is worse
1,@KevinShau Slippery slope fallacy
1,You aren't legislating subconscious
1,@KevinShau And yes I am aware it is an oversimplification but I feel it helps
1,@KevinShau And that is outside the rest of the facts in that case
1,@KevinShau Ignore the science. A woman you work with had an abortion

3,@KevinShau I wouldn't argue that we need to destroy traditional gender roles
1,@KevinShau I'll link you to monkeys throwing shit at eachother too
1,@KevinShau Traditional gender roles are breaking free naturally already
1,@KevinShau I agree on the first half
1,@KevinShau We have to make those careers friendly to women. Look at the percentage of women who report abuse in STEM fields
1,@KevinShau Because from a young age women aren't pushed into the idea that being housewives is a fine goal? That women should cook
1,@KevinShau Women are more likely to do housework
1,@KevinShau I'm on my phone in a car but that is stuff you can google or I can google for you when I'm near my desktop
1,@KevinShau When those are accounted for a large gap still exists. The exact portion of percent is just Semantics.
1,@KevinShau The gap takes into account most of those factors if not all. Even when accounted for
1,@KevinShau I�۪ve watched his videos on the wage gap

1,@magpies_history I was 12. Went with my Dad. All standing behind the goal when it went in. I wish I could have appreciated then how special it was. You can see me and my dad in the crowd when he scored.
1,@Zeitgeist24_7 If oz spend the next year losing he will be welcomed back with open arms. Bancroft will have to hope they don�۪t find a decent opener!
1,As an England cricket team fan it�۪s time to let the Aussies get on with it and focus on why we haven�۪t won away since 2016.
1,@Zeitgeist24_7 Yes. I did start to wonder if the world had gone a little crazy at this point. There does need to be some perspective. He hasn�۪t killed anyone
1,@Zeitgeist24_7 And why did they say it was sticky tape and not sandpaper? Did they think this sounded better?
1,And as a newer country their sporting achievements gives them a place on the world stage. They are also very patriotic and defensive of their country. This will have hurt proper Aussie cricket fans.
1,I should add I love Australia
1,@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasn�۪t that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.
1,Things don�۪t go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!
1,Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasn�۪t involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..
1,@Zeitgeist24_7 Have to wait 10 years for the autobiographies to know more!
1,@Zeitgeist24_7 Sure
0,Different to 2011. England players couldn�۪t relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising it�۪s harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.
1,Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players heads
1,I don�۪t understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergate
1,Only Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in control
1,All the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..
1,On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived
1,@kevina364 He is their KP.
1,He only cares about no1 and maybe the abuse had finally got to him. I know I�۪m supposed to hate Smith but I just feel sad
1,Care if the ball swings? He�۪s not bowling and none of the abuse has been personally aimed at him. Let�۪s say Warner did come to him with this plan surely telling your Captain and teammates is going to help your standing more esp when it was Warner idea! Warner is the KP of Aus..
1,My #sandpapergate thoughts for anyone who cares. I don�۪t get why Bancroft did it if it just came from Warner? Bancroft is new to the team
1,I really want Macc to get promoted. That is a horrid league to get out of and they have one of the smallest budgets and most of the club is run by fans. I loved my time at the club. #mtfc
1,.@GerritForward I didn�۪t see last promotion season. How does this team compare? 97/98 team were very special. They had such confidence it felt like we would never lose again

1,@AdelaideBarmies I do think football having huge academies sweeping all sporty boys up at 6 is bad for all other sports too. Parents suddenly think their 6 yr old is the next Ronaldo and other sports aren�۪t even thought about

1,@ZaltzCricket So we didn�۪t even set any more records?!?
1,@AdelaideBarmies Agreed. Sky have been good for the game but we need some t20 at least on regular tv
1,Nothing else compares. NZ is a tiny population compared to Eng and it�۪s not their number 1 sport. So yes we should expect to beat NZ and if we aren�۪t doing we need a massive rethink as a country about how we keep cricket as our no2 sport. #NZvsEng
1,No longer seem to. It�۪s not just a middle class sport like in England and they don�۪t have football academy that snap up any sporty 6 yr old and make their focus just football. But when I lived in NZ I rarely met a Kiki who cared about cricket

1,7. See prison as a way to rehabilitate rather than simply punish
1,6. Ban the export of live animals and increase the punishment for people found to be mistreating animals (life time ban should be the norm!)
1,5. Consumer rights need to be updated and tightened as we allow too many online rogue traders that you wouldn't see in your local shopping centre.
1,4. Re look at the system for house buying
