And to be more safer don�۪t register Facebook and social media _���_���_���_���_���_���am goin through a problem cuz of fcb
I said it 
@matty_lawrence Where in the bible did God said hell and lake fire? gosh I think am mistaken
Addicted to pains of life..
I thought they said if u  a ghost u can stay every where in any country without a passport but seriously do ghost need a passport to travel _���_���_���_���_���_���seriously confused them_���_���
A life when u need help from police means u are mental _���_���_���_���_���_���_���a life when u feel like a kidnapp and being tortured ur right taken from u and yet police got the guts to tell u bullshit
A life when u call police means u are the targets _���_���_���_���_���_���_���remember dey working for someone and destroying others life�۪s
Nobody on earth is supposed to live to be afraid _��� seriously no one on earth is to be afraid
Scandal made me famous!!! _���_���_���_�_�_���
Remember this there is powerful ppl in the world who are dead and oops _٪�_٪�dead walking _�_� remember those that kill never have in their mind
He that dwell in the secret place of the most high shall abound under the shadow of God!n_���_���_���_���in darkness he is with me!!!
And oops!! Put this in ur mind! Play a fool and let them think they fooling U
And oop remember Karma is a bitch!!! What goes around comes back around but u will not notice it
And oops! Remember every pain u go through is just a blessing  to ur diff life!!! God doesn�۪t let innocent ppl die
Remember God did not give something power on earth to destroy others!! Remember the world is filled with hypocrites and very wicked ppl
Don�۪t believe the lies they spit in ur ears
Loook at me as example!!!  God said he knew me before I came to the World
De bible said don�۪t pray so loud in church like a hypocrite but pray in silents_���_���remember the devil has millions ears everywhere with his angels
The bible said test thy spirit and see whether it from God or not!!! Don�۪t let someone abuse ur right on earth just becuz u think it the devil!! The devil rule on earth but not above!!! There is  a man who will confuse the world that he is God
Remember there is difference between God and gods!!! There is difference between Holy Spirit
If a stupid devil is torturing someone just becuz he sin_���than remember the devil wants that person since ages since he was born
Hell is not eternal
@matty_lawrence Hell is not permanent _���Hell is a punishment u go through just for being stubborn but seriously ask ur self if hell Is permanent how did Jesus went to hell 3days after death and went up in human form..._���_���Dont let them feed u lies in ur ears !!! Hell is just a punishment!!
https://t.co/rCbHdoIS5l
We want to school to learn to get a degree! Same goes to ur faith
Remember if the door of ur blessing is _��� locked_���_٪�_٪�_٪�always use the bible as a example they all went through hell but came back with great blessings
The word of God is ununderstandable
Example of Jesus!!!! He was born in flesh but die and came back in flesh!!! _���_���he was tortured cuz of his gift
Remember this he said my God my God why have u forsake me?? _���_���but at end !!! He became great with great blessings _���_�_�God love is understandably
@matty_lawrence And the bible said who are you to judge a fool!That same bible said Not everyone that called his name Jesus Jesus will go to heaven
@matty_lawrence And the fool who said there is no God was tested by God to see his glory _�_�was used by God_�_�_�_�The bible said come to me I will show u the way!!! Go to God if u doubt he will show u the way!!_���_���_���God said it shall be given seek and u will find!!! Be doubtful he will open ur mind

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I fail to see how you think a choice is equal to killing the elderly. Involuntary euthanasia isn't a thing. That's just murder. But then the choice to be euthanised isn't there either so maybe you should think about that cause first?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Wait I thought you said an unborn foetus was a person too? Isn't that three? Sacarsm.
Their lives have not begun yet
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Once again
And frankly
The amount of kids in care is ludicrous

Also
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Somehow I think all the kids in care
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews So women deserve for their lives to be ruined by a child they did not want
I think most women would prefer the choice. They don't have to take it
@_HarriRose _���_���_���
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews We are going round in circles love. I would rather have the choice to terminate a pregnancy that I do not want
@MadHatterJimmy Yeah I'm planning on a Corsair keyboard. And yeah I use my laptop screen when streaming. Again this screen is borrowed
@MadHatterJimmy Lol god no.
@MadHatterJimmy The headset was a present
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Whether it is likely or not those few women should be given the choice. And seeing as I live in England
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Intestines are developed outside the body and twist in. Definitely not all in place by then. There's no use in an undeveloped lung. It's like saying uncooked chicken is still suitable to eat. And what about protection from an abusive family due to being born of rape/force?

@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby... It would poison the mother if it wasn't removed.
And so the mother
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I think you best read up a little more. Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy. https://t.co/Wf2zVOopJM
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Contraception isn't 100% effective. Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. 
But you'll risk the well-being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked? It doesn't have the organs to survive alone...
@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews I'm sorry you had to go through that. The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman.
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Thanks for informing me on how a human is created... But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks. That is no life. 

I suppose you're someone who believes contraception is wrong too?
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Yet women aren't all given help. You're not killing a baby... It's not alive until it is born
Let women make their own choice about their bodies...
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews What about a mother who was raped
@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I'm not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn. It happens so often. -_- since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own?
@miliszan Thank you sweet. I keep being relieved I'm not but sad I'm not _���

@Apollocosplay @isdatbun I witnessed 2 security guards going behind a latex cosplayer taking a photo then go off to show another guard... I walked past them told them they were disgusting. Too afraid to do anything else.

@V3rmilion_N1nja It's a little one I had for when I had short hair. Usually I'd be able to clean out the filter but this one isn't designed like that so it's burning the dust and hair that's stuck.

@SaintSpartan03 Just wanting to see what would be the 2nd option in case I have to abandon Fortnite for the night lol
@SaintSpartan03 They did a bunch of background things and it's been down most of the day. Meaning that the wait times this evening might be crazy long.
Might stream something else other than Fortnite tonight as they've been updating the game most of today but the wait times if it comes back up may be ludicrous. 

Any other suggestions?

@Numinoceur Yup yup. I'm glad too tbh _��_ and yeah just a little bit too much _���
@Numinoceur Hahaha my mum stopped calling it fancy dress when I started modelling as well. Which is a plus. It's kinda cute tho they know we're into some weird nerdy shit but don't beat us down
"@Numinoceur At least it helped get your package! My mum does the same at her work... ""oh yeah my daughter's a right weirdo and goes to those comicons in London all the time"" _���"
Over a year later and @SquareEnix's @FFXVEN just keeps getting better and better for me.

Feel like I need to take a hiatus from cosplay. Nothing I turn out is good enough and there's so much drama around me at the moment it literally hurts. 
Maybe some time just gaming and streaming is what's needed with no cosplay.

HEY GUYS FYI I'VE TAKEN ART HISTORY AND BUDDHIST LITERATURE CLASSES AT UNI.

PLEASE CLAP.
this concept of an imperfect
some examples of wabi-sabi in zen  ������_��_: https://t.co/zLGTaPTtnT
It is a process of silencing the mind and thus removing the suffering of your own condition
"zen buddhism also has a concept I really like known as ""wabi-sabi"". it is the embrace of the ephemeral nature of all things and the imperfections of the human experience. enlightenment doesn't mean you're suddenly infallible"
you see this a lot in zen buddhism. there is an effort or lack thereof
this is sort of the nature of the phenomenon of the epiphany. it is a momentary grasp of a lucid
It is only when we become attached to expectations or external conceptions that by nature limit us or make us smaller that we slip out of that enlightenment. In that sense it is something you can slip in and out of. If all we have is the present
I forgot which sect(s) it is but in some form of Buddhism ������ there is the idea that everyone -- by default -- is already a buddha

https://t.co/kspTz9M8wj
https://t.co/u1ZyKQOBWY
"if you just see ""god"" as everything both within u and in relation to u as opposed to an omnipresent external judge this becomes a lot easier to process"
it's not that there was a specific person with a divine experience it's that we collectively chose to reinforce that idea and maintain it long enough over the course of history for it to be normalized.
Or idk that's just an idea. I mean think of how we give religious iconography strength and how faith and perceived cause-effect connections strengthen the impact of those religions.... _�_�

pls retweet https://t.co/1TMMY81mh8
I was in much more of a flow then so my transcendent subjective reality began to overlap more with the more mundane objective reality. It seems like whatever mass hysteria I sensed then had kind of died down a bit.
I gotta say my external reality certainly has changed significantly since I started posting again in Fall
maybe I'll just continue to subversively divert the ontological norms enough until my external reality presents me with a system that doesn't feel so stacked against me
do you ever think you might actually be more successful being a cult leader than actually getting the career of your dreams?

I honestly think the main motivating factor is that people like having the power using language and cultural norms to completely destroy someone. They love the suffering. They even love the suffering caused to the person's friends and loved ones.

These are not good people.
there's a difference between preventing a legitimately problematic person from having a platform and combing through a person's worst moments because you have a sociopathic desire for revenge against people you don't like
"the majority of what an ""activist"" spends their emotional energy on feeding into online says a lot more about their character than what they claim to stand for. these people are chumps and they maintain the 24 hour news cycle of shit. destroy them."

Historical revisionism. Plain and simple. The more we recognize propaganda as legitimate the more we're changing the legacy of American imperialism by absolving and softening crimes against humanity. It's appalling and more people should be upset.
We're trying to give war criminals the benefit of the doubt with retroactive praise via the mainstream media. You see it with the Bush family
RT @chomsky_quotes: One fundamental goal of any well-crafted indoctrination program is to direct attention elsewhere
Also why the fuck are we giving Obama a netflix series? We willingly lose paradise more and more every year. Why is HBO releasing a propaganda documentary on McCain just as he's about to croak? Does this not seem weird to anyone else?
Think of the impact technology and mass entertainment has had on re-wiring the brains of gen z. They live in a fundamentally warped view of the world.
Stop making shitty people famous. Stop making fame seem more important than it is. Reinstill the values that promote a healthy family unit or we'll continue to have parents who raise fuck up reactionary failchildren who resort to murder for attention.
In a world where sociopaths aren't given attention they'd rather take a legacy of infamy than no legacy at all. And honestly given how the media chooses to cover and oversaturate certain stories we really have no one but ourselves to blame. It's a byproduct of consumer culture.
honestly I think we have the media and entertainment culture to blame for the current political climate and to a large extent the school shooter epidemic. give attention to the wrong things

Weird facebook creators have more honor because they're mostly putting out OC and creating their own little recurring jokes and storylines.

Twitter is just about aping whatever thing is cool and trying to convince yourself that you're a comedian/woke/politically aware

2018: Hipster neurotypicals disregarding context for performative in-group brownie points and self-aggrandizement
The people who are denoted as geniuses by contemporary society are often given that status after that person has already become successful via either business or academia. It's retroactive. Clout. A reflection of that person's perceived success. Completely different.
I'd say that capitalism doesn't reward genius
It also suggests that genius is a product of society or history and not of the mind of an individual. How society perceives or ranks a figure has nothing to do with that individual's objective ability. https://t.co/Dn7lmA0NYh
All of these arguments are pulled out of thin air and poorly explained. Rubbish. No scientific or historical context whatsoever. Perfectly illustrates the myopia of the current culture. We've accelerated so much these clowns can't remember life before 2016.

Its a lot easier to process &amp; understand an experience someone else is describing if u have already experienced it. It's also a lot more intuitive if that's the case. And I've experienced things that over 95% of people never will. There will always be that phenomenological lacuna

Also a lot of people don't trust their intuition enough. They'll stay in a toxic place or with toxic people despite that being a huge factor in feeling distressed. It takes courage to listen to your mind and body and follow through
I'm more content now than I probably have ever been because most external factors don't phase me like they used to. The energy I'm not wasting ruminating or worrying about a self in some competitive psychodrama has kept me in a creative flow

This is one problem with giving the authority for primary sources to very select publications because these publications will abuse that power to write history as they see fit. This is a fundamental problem with historicity
Keep this in mind when you see the NYT
the NYT plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world on the part of the politically active educated classes...and I believe that NYT editors bear a heavy burden in the sense that the NYT creates history - Noam Chomsky

https://t.co/opNr1ONrUU
Isnt it a bit odd that the media &amp; oafish elites threw a bigger fit about Michelle Wolf's correspondence dinner speech than literally any of the war escalation and massacres of Palestinians in the past several weeks? We need a revolution in journalism.
My grammar was all over the place in those tweets but I hope what I said made sense
How much do you see Trump being used as a target instead of legitimately more terrifying tactics used by the GOP like ramping up ICE

https://t.co/6x3StGagxh
It's not so much that Trump is that paper tiger it's that the media focuses so much on trivial one upsmanship. Liberals care more about proving everyone else wrong with an elitist mentality than actually doing anything to combat the looming spectre of fascism
If they have a paper tiger they can always prop up to distract from whats going on behind the scenes. You see time and time again in American history fear in conjunction with the media used to create artificial antagonism and diversion
Then again I am still shocked daily by how ignorant and gullible the American public is

The cyclical nature of addiction and mental illness is really sad
This was back in like 2012/13 btw when I was off the rails
So it went almost from a compulsion to just a normal extension of my character. Empathy is good.
It sorta started when I had mania and would walk around at like 3 in the morning in sketchy areas of downtown but I really don't mind talking to or even chilling for a bit with homeless people. They are a lot more wise than people realize
Well that was kind of a weird experience but I'm glad I stuck around to talk to the guy. It's really hard for the homeless especially in Seattle
I'm smoking a joint with a homeless guy in his tent by I-5 because his tobacco and weed got stolen

So many things would not be problems if people were okay with explaining or asking to clarify. People read way too much into such trivial things. Double texting? Who cares
But instead people see something
It's okay to like actually call up your friends you know. Like catching up with them
So much pain all around from assumptions just because everyone is too weak to communicate like people with other people.

"Somehow in Western society we've detached ""the bedroom"" from every other aspect of life almost as if that isn't directly feeding into the rest of culture. It is. People are sick."
Somehow sexual abuse is cool if you're paid to do it and she's into it? But those very same people with masochist fetishes are radical leftist hardliners. Very contradictory logic for contemporary feminism IMO. _٪�
"there is so much contradictory weird Freudian shit going on with ""Daddy"" culture and intersectionalism. Pornography is almost inherently misogynistic and somehow we separate fetishes and taboo sexual activities from the rest of fodder for thinkpiece writers"
The end goal all ties back into a sort of totalitarian indoctrination that squashes dissent with conformity. It's basically like intersectionalism is cucking your rights away. I dread the next implementation phase of the new world order as it relates to freedom of speech

And my anger always shifts to disappointment and pathos
Especially when you can stand back far enough from it all to see how time and time again it is their own arrogance and vanity that undermines them
Seeing people not grow or learn from mistakes despite being successful or making strides in other aspects of their lives is such a massive disappointment
Not even seeing their bad karma unfold in real time brings any sense of grim satisfaction or closure bc ultimately you realize they're the same person they were when they fucked you up. There's just a hollow separateness in which you see someone walking into a wall ad infinitum
Or they just plug their ears and go LALALALALALALA while whatever guilt they still have slowly festers inside them
Social media allows people to forget and move on so easily. Redemption doesn't even exist anymore and they all just hop from one botched relationship to another
and so all the catharsis from the night before evaporates like nothing ever happened

So uh
A lotta people also have to consider that Buddhism is rough. Like there is a lot of dark shit
When cancel culture and media propaganda is no longer the status quo (which will likely not happen for as long as MSM exists) then I may consider saying things more palatable and optimistically righteous or whatever
And you know
Again
Having said that I will still totally dunk on people or tear them to shreds if they abuse power or have shitty takes or make the web deliberately more fractured and toxic. Maybe that's just the nihilist vigilante in me idk. And yeah
However
I'd say I lean more towards criticizing culture
@ByYourLogic are there still hostages
If we can widen the range of discussion for our lively debate to occur in that's a pro in my book
I try to use humor to frame a lot of my more taboo opinions but I know for a fact a LOT of people don't get me or find me funny and I'm cool with that because that's the position of vulnerability you have to put yourself in to make a difference
I mean I hate cops. So there's that. I hate Israel. Tricky
I mean

I'm not really sure how I can frame my content lol.
You're perfectly free to disagree with me or call me a bigot but frankly I'm detached enough from my online persona for it to impact my day to day life. It's completely another thing if or as soon as my career enters the public sphere but idc my life is already in shambles
there are definitely a lot of shitty people with shady morals about but I still think the majority are just pretty normal people who are against mainstream bipartisanship and normie scum. I often due things to offend but primarily for the sake of widening a window of discussion
Even though I consider myself primarily a leftist anarchist I sometimes resonate more with certain alt-lite trolls than tankies you know what I mean
leftist twitter beef is such a joke lol. I have such a weak grasp on the political spectrum of most of the accounts I like. I follow a ton of people on here I disagree with significantly but I follow them because I think it's important to observe the gestalt of the discourse
really resonates with me for where I'm at in my artistic/literary path and the methods which I employ for expressing my ideas &amp; emotions

@KevinShau I'd be very quick to be wary on any stat with one source.  Given that I've attempted to include multiple articles with the same points on anything you have asked for sources on.
@KevinShau We had a very large debate about the Wage gap on Facebook
@KevinShau I would refer you back to my multiple tweets regarding how I do my research that include looking through sources such as Brietbart
@KevinShau You can skip the parts you find offensive
@KevinShau We have already had discussions of me breaking apart both Shapiro and Peterson's videos piece by piece.  We can do more of that
@KevinShau I do not follow a party
@KevinShau I did not see those interviews on his channel
TYT is a left wing Alex jones
@KevinShau Again
@KevinShau I think you do not understand the marketing piece here
@KevinShau I'm not planning to read an 80 year old
@KevinShau I was giving you multiple articles with confirmation of the question you asked.  I'm sorry you do not like the author's writing style.  Personally
@KevinShau Also
@KevinShau I'll give this a watch through today.  Regardless of how it plays out
"@KevinShau You should know pretty well that I break from the ""leftist"" mold quite frequently.  I do thorough research through multiple sources from both ""sides"""
@KevinShau I've watched hours of his lectures
I'm not intentionally condescending
@KevinShau The type of content in demand by people like Jones
@KevinShau Dave Rubin is opening on tour for Jordan Peterson and tweets about Peterson as a regular thing.  I also do not see any notable progressive or modern liberal people on his channel.  If you can not see and look past your own bias
@KevinShau I believe that the opinion of Pool's validity is going to be an irreconcilable difference here.  I've watched his videos and I see what they are compared to Journalists who win real awards
@KevinShau Trump denounced the KKK
@KevinShau Unnecessary
@KevinShau Fallacy of anecdotal evidence
@KevinShau https://t.co/crXHjpzjpB
@KevinShau https://t.co/csAHlNplmc
@KevinShau 2/2 One for you
https://t.co/4YCHPuexGH
@KevinShau 1/2: I'm worried that your claim for sources will result in your attempt to attack reputable news organizations instead of furthering discussion.
That being said:
@KevinShau You asked for sources in a second tweet
@KevinShau For instance:  Violent crime by illegal immigrants is a huge issue in this country.  Emotionally? That may seem agreeable to a lot of people.  Factually
@KevinShau Spoiler: That's the point.
"@KevinShau ""Data is objective"
I'm going to just let that sit there so you can just rethink that sentence. Think about that one REAL hard.
@KevinShau Thats because Peterson makes sure to debate reporters and students
@KevinShau I'm sorry you see it that way
@KevinShau If there is greater access
@KevinShau I'm aware of biases in media and I take my news from either the most direct point possible
@KevinShau You're not commenting on my point.  I'm not saying that CNN is right
@KevinShau I'll repeat:  All his fans are not alt-right
@KevinShau Just because I hate Kevin Spacey does not mean kevin spacey also hates me
@KevinShau Peterson also works in the same way the alt-right does
"@KevinShau Nobody I have seen is saying ""all his fans are alt-right"""
A lot of people are saying he has a very large alt-right fanbase
@KevinShau Regardless of Peterson's true feelings towards the alt-right
@KevinShau Dealing in facts is a much better way to get results. Dealing in opinions generally leads to emotional reactions over sensible reactions.
"@KevinShau I saw it was neck and neck with John Oliver's ""Marlon Bundo"" book for a while"
@KevinShau I'm not mischaracterizing Pool.  He said that Peterson does like like the alt-right
@KevinShau The only other self described news I had seen it done on was Jones
@KevinShau If someone somehow found that Vox article before any other information
@KevinShau I'm not characterizing
@KevinShau He's a pseudo-intellectual snake oil salesman.  I know I'm attacking him as a person
@KevinShau Pool
@KevinShau This is not journalism
@KevinShau 9/?
Pool so far has not shown any evidence the alt right doesn't like peterson(minus a quote from..peterson)
Also He did not even dismissed his OWN straw-man argument provided at the beginning of this video.
@KevinShau 8/?
"Pool earlier attacked the media for exageratting subscribers on youtube by saying ""thousands"" when in reality it is ""millions"".  He then goes back to say it is not millions.  (So at the least they are both idiots?)."
@KevinShau 7/?
Hold on
"@KevinShau 6/?  This is a 16 minute video and 10 minutes has been spent saying Peterson says he doesn't play identity politics"".  Pool made a point to say the alt-right doesnt like Peterson"
@KevinShau 5/?
"Also:  Pool keeps saying that ""Peterson denied being alt right meaning he doesn't have alt right fans"" but that is a logical fallacy in itself. Peterson can dislike the alt-right"
"@KevinShau 4/?He attacks the ""daily dot"" opinion article"
@KevinShau 3/?
"Pool criticizes an old video for saying Peterson has ""hundreds of thousands of followers"" on youtube when it is actually just over a million.  Seems nitpicky"
@KevinShau 2/?
Then he asked for money(is this alex jones?!).  Then he said that the alt-right couldn't love peterson
@KevinShau 1/?  I watched another one of Pool's videos:
Why is the media lying about Jordan Peterson(I thought it was relevant to the rest of this topic).
He starts out by creating a strawman argument that Peterson is aligning with facist organizations.
"@KevinShau ""Peterson himself said in his Channel 4 interview that 80 percent of his YouTube audience is male. These young men are upset about . .  the need to compete with women and minorities for jobs and spots at top universities"
@KevinShau Additionally
@KevinShau While I'm not in love with the source website

https://t.co/71Fx8cTKCH
"@KevinShau There is another LARGE difference between a ""unpopular"" position"
@KevinShau 3/3: Those letters also affirmed Peterson�۪s free speech rights and his right to academic freedom.
@KevinShau 2/3: One letter suggested that he could easily avoid contributing to discrimination by using a student�۪s first name
@KevinShau 1/3: That is avoiding the point that Peterson was upset at a bill for something the bill did not do.  Instead of targeting the code
@KevinShau I do not know his work
@KevinShau No
@KevinShau https://t.co/Hw0mt7pRCR
@KevinShau We have discussed this numerous times
@KevinShau I'm sure it would
@KevinShau There are plenty of experts in that field.  None of which have said that Women want to help muslims so they can be dominated.
Peterson is in the wrong here
"@KevinShau and ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination"" is not an interest or desire of an entire gender"
I'd argue if you browse craigslist
"@KevinShau There is a LARGE difference between saying not ""only great things"" and ""Sexist"
@KevinShau 3/2: Now to be fair
@KevinShau Not every piece that outs a fraud is a hit piece
Not to mention Peterson has *multiple times* touted his honorary tribal membership that does not exist
@KevinShau If you are trying to claim this man as a good journalist
@KevinShau I have to have some fun!
Did you read the piece though?
@KevinShau That neither addressed my point nor made one
@KevinShau NYT
Pool won an award that was given out to a Ke$ha(musician) fan club.(The Shorty)
@KevinShau 2/2:
He even testified before Parliament on this

"This is ""slippery slope"" fallacy AGAIN"
@KevinShau 1/2: on C-16
Peterson claimed that adding gender identity to the protected classes could possibly
@KevinShau I am not going to argue if that is right or wrong
@KevinShau It is not good.  So Peterson is right that it is a bad movie
@KevinShau Also
@KevinShau Something rooted in sexism
"@KevinShau Neither was saying that Feminists support the rights of Muslims because of their ""unconscious wish for brutal male dominance"" nor"
it's good that you consumed the liquor instead of letting some Indian steal it(especially after crying honorary native american!  Pocohantus much?
@KevinShau https://t.co/uyZXVyW4G8
"Also I find his defense against racism that he is ""Honorary tribe member"" hilarious."
"@KevinShau You touted him as ""award winning"""
@KevinShau https://t.co/tIxxid9RVX
Also a great piece by Petardson approved Source
"@KevinShau To quote the same sources Peterson uses: ""Dr. Peterson is a sexist. . . However"
@KevinShau But Epic Meal Time rival
"@KevinShau ""nor must of his supporters are alt-right."""
#NAME?

My sources win Pulitzer prizes
@KevinShau I don't recall Tim Pool arguing that opinion pieces are the downfall of media.  This is an opinion piece you are attacking.
@KevinShau Peterson argued that the Disney movie Frozen is propaganda which isn't relevant but is pretty hilarious
"@KevinShau Peterson also argued that women support the Muslim plight because it matched with their ""unconscious wish for brutal male domination'"
@KevinShau This coincidentally is in an interview with Peterson from Time magazine. Slippery slope present and highlighted https://t.co/fkfjyNgtz9
@KevinShau Your using Pool repeatedly as an example of an intellectual is laughable. He won an unrecognizable award(same award was given to Epic Meal Time and Justin Bieber)
He also was named Time person solely for live streaming an event on twitter. Hardly prestige earning
@KevinShau It's an analysis based in fact. 
Ben Carson is a neurosurgeon
@KevinShau Most of the alt right agrees with him.
I do my research well
@KevinShau https://t.co/QoRJ0L9JdL
Please do read this
@KevinShau Peterson is sexist and at the very least probably islamophoboc. He argues using common logical fallacies
@KevinShau Peterson preys on disaffected young men
@KevinShau Peterson is arguing conflicting points with conflicting data and poor sources
@KevinShau He sources Reddit
@KevinShau I'd also question the Forced Monogomy Peterson proposes as a solution. That seems a lot like forcing a lifestyle choice

@KevinShau I'll take time to look at the rest
@KevinShau Government should not discriminate
@KevinShau Yet Trump did
@KevinShau Historically this has always been the case
@KevinShau So let's allow people to be discriminated against?
Fix the politics
@KevinShau Again
Don't say oh well it confuses me so let's let these people suffer discrimination
@KevinShau So

Instead of working to define these terms
@KevinShau That's is a false analogy
@KevinShau When has that happened? And don't mention Canada because we have discussed that isn't what the law is
@KevinShau Can you provide evidence? I'd argue it was on the decline slowly and the legislation speeded up the decline
@KevinShau A transgender person is an individual
@KevinShau Though most do
@KevinShau Most biological males also identify as straight
@KevinShau Another humans gender identity affects you in no wsy. Forcing them to narrow theirs down to once of two is unnecessary and wrong
@KevinShau You're thinking of biological sex
@KevinShau I trust a group of well informed and educated people more than the mass population.
@KevinShau Shaming a gender is worse
@KevinShau Slippery slope fallacy
You aren't legislating subconscious
@KevinShau And yes I am aware it is an oversimplification but I feel it helps
@KevinShau And that is outside the rest of the facts in that case
@KevinShau Ignore the science. A woman you work with had an abortion
@KevinShau There is a large difference between a sage space and a non hostile work environment.
Spewing blatant sexist garbage is a hostile work environment
@KevinShau Damore was
@KevinShau This video was to show the bosses of parents and the idea that we subconsciously place gender roles on others
@KevinShau Nobody wants to force someone to act in a way that doesn't match their gender
@KevinShau Then you should do basic research
@KevinShau  https://t.co/vTAuboAy4g
@KevinShau James Damore got fired for being an idiot
https://t.co/0iZPuPV2nG
@KevinShau https://t.co/Ly27jPg6aa
@KevinShau I wouldn't argue that we need to destroy traditional gender roles
@KevinShau I'll link you to monkeys throwing shit at eachother too
@KevinShau Traditional gender roles are breaking free naturally already
@KevinShau I agree on the first half
@KevinShau We have to make those careers friendly to women. Look at the percentage of women who report abuse in STEM fields
@KevinShau Because from a young age women aren't pushed into the idea that being housewives is a fine goal? That women should cook
@KevinShau Women are more likely to do housework
@KevinShau I'm on my phone in a car but that is stuff you can google or I can google for you when I'm near my desktop
@KevinShau When those are accounted for a large gap still exists. The exact portion of percent is just Semantics.
@KevinShau The gap takes into account most of those factors if not all. Even when accounted for
@KevinShau I�۪ve watched his videos on the wage gap
@KevinShau Let's not Use the term journalist so frivolously

@magpies_history I was 12. Went with my Dad. All standing behind the goal when it went in. I wish I could have appreciated then how special it was. You can see me and my dad in the crowd when he scored.
@Zeitgeist24_7 If oz spend the next year losing he will be welcomed back with open arms. Bancroft will have to hope they don�۪t find a decent opener!
As an England cricket team fan it�۪s time to let the Aussies get on with it and focus on why we haven�۪t won away since 2016.
@Zeitgeist24_7 Yes. I did start to wonder if the world had gone a little crazy at this point. There does need to be some perspective. He hasn�۪t killed anyone
@Zeitgeist24_7 And why did they say it was sticky tape and not sandpaper? Did they think this sounded better?
And as a newer country their sporting achievements gives them a place on the world stage. They are also very patriotic and defensive of their country. This will have hurt proper Aussie cricket fans.
I should add I love Australia
@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasn�۪t that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.
Things don�۪t go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!
Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasn�۪t involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..
@Zeitgeist24_7 Have to wait 10 years for the autobiographies to know more!
@Zeitgeist24_7 Sure
Different to 2011. England players couldn�۪t relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising it�۪s harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.
Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players heads
I don�۪t understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergate
Only Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in control
All the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..
On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived
@kevina364 He is their KP.
He only cares about no1 and maybe the abuse had finally got to him. I know I�۪m supposed to hate Smith but I just feel sad
Care if the ball swings? He�۪s not bowling and none of the abuse has been personally aimed at him. Let�۪s say Warner did come to him with this plan surely telling your Captain and teammates is going to help your standing more esp when it was Warner idea! Warner is the KP of Aus..
My #sandpapergate thoughts for anyone who cares. I don�۪t get why Bancroft did it if it just came from Warner? Bancroft is new to the team
I really want Macc to get promoted. That is a horrid league to get out of and they have one of the smallest budgets and most of the club is run by fans. I loved my time at the club. #mtfc
.@GerritForward I didn�۪t see last promotion season. How does this team compare? 97/98 team were very special. They had such confidence it felt like we would never lose again
I�۪ve got to that age where I realise how much education is wasted on the young and how much I would love the chance to study politics or my a levels again. Still I did have fun back then!

I don�۪t feel sorry for Bancroft especially after the way he acted re Bairstow but let�۪s be honest if he got told to do this he either risked his career or did as the older kids told him to do! Using him would have been a calculated risk as the least valuable player #savaus

Notts have dropped to 4th and league 2 is so tight. All teams are dropping points. I think we will go up automatically or not at all (we would lose to Mansfield in the playoffs!!) and I want that more right now than I want to wake up and find I�۪m at Disneyworld! #ncfc #notts
As my bio points out I don�۪t just discuss cricket so onto other subjects!!!
@thelassheather Oh and the ppl who think if England lose that your holiday must have been terrible. Sure I wanted England to win in Oz but I didn�۪t spend the evening crying alone in my room! In fact except the funny moments I forget the cricket!
@thelassheather I like it when fans talk about dropping players like we have players better than Cook and Broad etc just waiting to play!
@AdelaideBarmies We also have areas with 2nd gen Indian children who do love the game (huge numbers turn out when India are in town) but we have had little success in finding players
@AdelaideBarmies I do think football having huge academies sweeping all sporty boys up at 6 is bad for all other sports too. Parents suddenly think their 6 yr old is the next Ronaldo and other sports aren�۪t even thought about
@TheAshes1011 That draw was amazing. I saw England win the ashes at trent bridge but that draw was the most tense I�۪ve ever been at a cricket game!!
@daznccc Bet Broady was happy about that one
@ZaltzCricket So we didn�۪t even set any more records?!?
@AdelaideBarmies Agreed. Sky have been good for the game but we need some t20 at least on regular tv
Nothing else compares. NZ is a tiny population compared to Eng and it�۪s not their number 1 sport. So yes we should expect to beat NZ and if we aren�۪t doing we need a massive rethink as a country about how we keep cricket as our no2 sport. #NZvsEng
No longer seem to. It�۪s not just a middle class sport like in England and they don�۪t have football academy that snap up any sporty 6 yr old and make their focus just football. But when I lived in NZ I rarely met a Kiki who cared about cricket
Some thoughts for what they are worth... When I lived in Oz I *got* why they were good at cricket. Head to any park and see little kids playing the game
England cricket assisting me in getting ready for England football this summer. False hope followed by reality!

@twomuch77 I�۪m not saying this is the answer but like drug laws we can�۪t have a sensible conversation without people screaming about it.
@twomuch77 Well in America for example you can go direct to a specialist rather than through a GP. in Australia you can see a GP 24/7 but you pay for the privilege. We need to look at all ideas and be open to change
What tv shows do you watch again and again? Mine is the office (American version!) god knows how many times I�۪ve seen it!
@twomuch77 I don�۪t think it�۪s just about money. It�۪s about changing the whole way we use the service. I�۪m not necessary against money being raised through taxation I just think it�۪s an issue that no one can have an adult conversation about without ppl screaming that we are moving to US
@twomuch77 Exactly! We need to have that conversation. We have to pay more one way or another!

I worked for the club 10 years ago and it didn�۪t end well. In fact it ended up with me utterly broken and falling out of love with the club. I�۪ve tried for a long time to get it back and it�۪s been so hard. Finally this season I am feeling it again and caring how
Something good about tonight... I started watching Notts in 1991 when I was 10. Me and my dad going to every home game and the odd away game together. Having that time with my dad was amazing
Fair play to Notts fans who sang all game. That mentality isn�۪t always there in football anymore and it was great to see #notts
Sometimes I feel sad that my best years of watching Notts was when I was 9 - 14 and didn�۪t really appreciate it but then I remember we have fans who have only ever seen us in the bottom 2 divisions after years of watching us #notts
Well focusing on the league is important and we did make some decent money. We have to get out of this league.

Oh and remove the fine for taking children out of school during term time (up to year 9) Leave it to the discretion of the school. The current policy shows little understanding how important family time is and what it is like for the average person to get time off during summer
10. Overall strive to be the party of a fairer society
9. Stop talking about the internet like something you have just discovered / been told about . Everytime I hear a Tory MP discuss the internet I cringe.
8. Might seem petty but remove subsided bars / food from parliament. We need to regrow trust in our MPs and things like this just wind people up!
7. See prison as a way to rehabilitate rather than simply punish
6. Ban the export of live animals and increase the punishment for people found to be mistreating animals (life time ban should be the norm!)
5. Consumer rights need to be updated and tightened as we allow too many online rogue traders that you wouldn't see in your local shopping centre.
4. Re look at the system for house buying
3. As less people can afford to buy look at better rights for both tenants and landlords. Good landlords and tenants need to be treated better and rogue landlords should have banning orders / more severe punishment.

@NottsAde What a joke mate. Have noticed the exec boxes are the poor man of hospitality
sport. That if you haven't place a bet on a Saturday whilst watching sport you aren't doing it right.
Thanks to these experiences I now want much stricter regulations within the gambling industry from lowering the max spin bet to removing ATMs from bingo halls and to make self exclusion a lot simpler. We also need to break this idea that gambling now comes hand in hand with
feel you are one more spin away from winning. Smoking might kill you over a long period but gambling can ruin your life in a day. Although I believe in free choice I also dont like how the gambling industry preys on those that have the least and who need money the most.

The system also discriminates against home owners

@Johnnysmalls78 Oh and accept the rules of football marketing which says that any offer and crowd equals poor performance on the pitch.
@Johnnysmalls78 Ensure you hold him personally responsible for mushy peas running out before KO. The only time I lost patience with a fan was one who PMed me on fb on a Sunday morning to complain about catering
@Johnnysmalls78 Also tut loudly that these new people dont know the name of all the players and have kids with them that want the toilet before the end of the first half
@Johnnysmalls78 Oh and call the club every 10 mins from 10am asking if the game is still on even though its 10c and it hasnt rained in a week! Also if you want to complain club staff love it if you find their private fb and message them early on Sunday with your complaint.
@Johnnysmalls78 complain that there is a line to get a pie at half time! Oh and that getting out the ground was a fire hazard!

@_mrsmp_ @JackBarratt1994 yep 1997 - Teacher was very angry at me for being a Tory
@rickiggyjordan Yes of course.
@Marriotti67 I'm not a fan of them for those reasons. I might be a tory but I don't agree with everything the party does.
@ninalouise1975 I work within my own party to make changes. I am only a vegetarian working towards veganism. I care for animals not just ones that look cute
@JackBarratt1994 The problem is the way teachers teach that subject. But the art of debate should be taught
@ninalouise1975 Nina. I have fought hard to tighten the ban and to bring in more animal rights. What have you done?
All over religion should be taught in RS classes only and not as indoctrination into our young.
Am I wrong to want to ban ALL religious schools? I think only cultural Christianity should be celebrated at school (Christmas and Easter)...
The way we treat animals in society is the first brick in the society we want to build. Tories need to lead on animal rights

Poor Fumiko. She is not doing well about our potential move. She came home crying from school and said she had a mental breakdown about moving. _��_ I think not knowing when is what is really upsetting her. We don�۪t know when a spot will open up and when it does we have 10 days.
